Hi! It is me, Haris, a doctoral student at the Social Informatics, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University. I am in the integrated sciences program that combines fast-paced information technology and several other disciplines to solve a social problem. Here, I am focusing on implementing disaster risk governance for ashfall hazards during imminent large eruptions. We are exposed to natural disaster risk every day due to our socio-economics activities. It is our responsibility to realize a safe and secure society to live harmoniously with natural disasters. The vast improvement of the current technology (AI, Machine Learning, etc.) can be incorporated to help manage natural disaster risks more effectively and to provide better response towards its impacts.

I have been researching on disaster risk management since my undergraduate. I did flood risk assessment and analysis on evacuation mechanism for disabilities people from Tsunami through escape bunker during that period. I shifted to ashfall hazards from large eruptions in the masters and further delved into this topic in my current degree. I simulated the ashfall dispersion from Sakurajima volcano for 62 years from 1958 to 2019 and successfully clarified the risk assessment.  I identified the time when ashfall hazards hit the hardest to Japan region and elucidated how the early warning is an essential part to lessen its impact. Now, I am expanding this research to produce more comprehensive disaster risk governance system using the combination of machine learning, big data, and social sciences.
